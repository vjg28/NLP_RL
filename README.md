# NLP_RL
## Use
- Git clone the repo. Enter `datasets` folder and unzip all three files. Those files are the preprocessed data of NarrativeQA dataset for the code.
- That just saved you 12 hours of pre-processing. :) 
- Run `python3 train_span.py`
- Wait for everything to happen.


## Safety points
- Still don't know whether thr intra-attention function is correct or not. Check Issues in the original repo.
- Multi-gpu code gives error. No clue. :(
- If you have 12 hours to pass your time, do use prep codes with python 2 for preprocessing.
- Still onto testing
